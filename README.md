# Swahili_News_Classification

Classification of Swahili news articles using NLP techniques.

This project will investigate three different approaches to the problem of Swahili news classification. Three contrasting algorithms will be explored, namely,

- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Transformers - BERT model

In order to implement news classification, the dataset first requires significant preprocessing and data exploration which will be performed in the first notebook. The notebook structure is as follows:

- 1 - Data Preparation and Exploration
- 2 - Classical Approaches: Naive Bayes and SVM
- 3 - Deep Leaning Approaches: Exploring transformers
